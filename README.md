<h2 align="left">Hello I'm Sunikhil thakur</h2>
I’m a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate at Chitkara University, Punjab, pursuing a B.E. in CSE.
With strong proficiency in C++ and Java, I have a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, which complements my passion for problem-solving and efficient coding.

💻 My journey extends into full-stack web development, where I’ve gained hands-on experience with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I love building scalable and dynamic web applications and am always eager to explore new technologies.

🚀 Committed to continuous learning, I actively stay updated with emerging tech trends and enjoy integrating modern tools and frameworks into my projects. I thrive in dynamic environments that demand creativity, innovation, and a deep understanding of programming fundamentals.

🔍 I’m currently seeking opportunities to apply and grow my skills in real-world projects — always excited to tackle new challenges and contribute meaningfully to impactful work!
