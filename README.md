<h2 align="left">Hello 👋 I'm Sunikhil Thakur</h2>

🎓 I’m a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate at **Chitkara University, Punjab**, pursuing a B.E. in CSE.  
With strong proficiency in **C++** and **Java**, I have a solid foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms**, which complements my passion for problem-solving and efficient coding.

💻 My journey extends into **full-stack web development**, where I’ve gained hands-on experience with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I love building scalable and dynamic web applications and am always eager to explore new technologies.

🚀 Committed to continuous learning, I actively stay updated with emerging tech trends and enjoy integrating modern tools and frameworks into my projects. I thrive in dynamic environments that demand creativity, innovation, and a deep understanding of programming fundamentals.

🔍 I’m currently seeking opportunities to apply and grow my skills in real-world projects — always excited to tackle new challenges and contribute meaningfully to impactful work!
